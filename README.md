To increase privacy in public spaces the Privacy Extension For WhatsApp™ Web blurs your messages. Your messages and other content only reveals upon hovering over with your mouse cursor. Additionally you can quickly toggle all effects by using a keyboard shortcut or by clicking the toggle button in the extension menu.

**Customize it**

It adapts to your needs by letting you decide which elements you want to blur. Your options:

- All messages in chat: *Blurs all messages in the current chat.*
- Last messages preview: *Blurs all message previews on the left.*
- Media preview: *Blurs all images, videos, stickers, ... in separation from the text.*
- Media gallery: *Blurs all small icons of images, videos, ... while viewing an image, video, ...*
- Text input: *Makes the color in your input field lighter to make it hard to read.*
- Profile pictures: *Blurs all profile pictures.*
- Group/Users names: *Blurs all group and usernames.*
- No transition delay: *Allows you to turn off the delay before revealing an item on hover.*
- Unblur all on app hover: *Unblurs all elements when you hover over the WhatsApp Web app.*

**Quick Toggle**

You can quickly toggle the blur in the settings or with a keyboard shortcut (Default: Alt+X).
